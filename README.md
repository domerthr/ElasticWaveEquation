# Elastic Wave Equation

This project provides an mplementation of the **elastic wave equation** using space-time Galerkin finite elements such as:

- `cG(s)/cG(r)`
- `cg(s)/cG(r)-cG(r)`
- `cG(s)/dG(r)`

The goal is, to offer these three schemes and the implementation of initial and final time conditions for the velocity.
